PsyGlass: An Open-Source Framework for Implementing Google Glass in Research Settings

Before implementing, we recommend reading through the files to familiarize yourself with the code.

Be sure to change the server string ("public static final String ADDRESS" variable in "GameActivity.java" file) to target server address. Please note that server-connection functionalities may be limited when testing from Android Studio. We recommend publishing the signed APK with the target server address and uploading the app to your Glass to fully test server connection.

Transfer the following files and folders to the target server location before running:
		data.html
		experiment.html
		index.html	
		"resources" folder
		"data" folder (should be given read, write, and execute permissions)
